# Next build changes

## Current authorized step: standalone Pico base 0.2.0 with optional MQTT

- [x] Start with updated Node.js discovery/configuration and TCP request methods.
- [x] Carry over the owner's sensor mappings, pitch/roll and Ella JSON calculations/formatting from Python.
- [x] Exclude SignalK integration. The initial MQTT exclusion was superseded by the owner's 2026-10-08 request for publishing to the existing dashboard.
- [x] Add fragmented TCP reads, error/retry handling, sender checks and clean shutdown.
- [x] Compare normal readings with the original Python functions and test simulated connection failures/recovery.
- [x] Provide recording, verification and replay commands for a live Pi test.
- [x] Support installation directly in `~/PicoData/node.js`, including a bundled Python comparison reference so deleted original folders are not needed.
- [x] Receive configurations and live readings from the owner's actual Pico; 1,096 captured outputs match the original Python, with zero differences (owner-reported verification).
- [x] Confirm real receive frame lengths/checksums for the reported capture: 108 TCP responses and 1,096 UDP packets all pass.
- [ ] Confirm automatic discovery mode and record Pico firmware/device identity and Pi Node.js version.
- [ ] Confirm live readings against the existing Node-RED/Pico display and exercise Wi-Fi loss/Pico restart.

## MQTT addition — 2026-10-08

- [x] Add optional publishing using the existing five-key Python `mqtt` configuration file.
- [x] Preserve the exact configured topic, parsed JSON structure/values/labels/units, QoS 0 and non-retained messages.
- [x] Restore original raw-65535 value handling in MQTT compatibility mode; reject incomplete output snapshots.
- [x] Add independent reconnect, no offline backlog/resync, bounded pending writes and clean shutdown.
- [x] Test actual MQTT wire settings and received CLI payloads against the Python source; verify Pico output continues with broker access denied.
- [ ] Test the publisher against the owner's Mosquitto broker and existing Node-RED dashboard.

## Proposed Pi logging direction

- Keep collection/logging on the always-on, headless Pi Zero 2 W; the head unit is not continuously powered.
- Prefer one focused service over an expanding dashboard/database stack. Measure actual memory/CPU before replacing working services.
- SQLite plus a small history API is the preferred proposal; sampling, retention and final display/app architecture remain to be agreed. No logging/API/UI implementation is included in this MQTT addition.
- Keep history on persistent storage outside zram-managed directories (proposed `/var/lib/ella/`), with batched durable commits; reserve `/var/log` for diagnostics.
- Add ElectroDacus MQTT decoding later, preserving the existing Mosquitto destination during validation.

## Later Android work

- Start the Android port after reviewing the live Pi evidence; confirm target hardware, Android range, layout and background requirements first.
- Add ElectroDacus MQTT reception later. Review Android's role as a viewer/client of the Pi logger; direct Pico/embedded-broker operation can remain a separate future option. The current step implements optional Pico MQTT publishing only.
- Keep SignalK functionality outside the Android scope.
